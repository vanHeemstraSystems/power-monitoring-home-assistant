## Devices with power (W) sensors

Some smart devices, such as air conditioning, boilers, and others, may provide a power sensor, measured in Watts. You can use the Integration (Riemann sum integral) integration to calculate the energy your device is using. You can then use the energy sensor in the Energy Dashboard, as individual devices.
